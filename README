INSTALLING THE NING APP TO A LOCAL SERVER FOR DEVELOPMENT

git://github.com/ning/ningapp-topfriends.git

After cloning the repository, you may copy the code to your own server and 
add the gadget.xml file to a test Ning Network by URL. As the Javascript and 
CSS in the gadget.xml has been optimized using Google's Closure Compiler 
Service (http://closure-compiler.appspot.com/home), feel free to refer to 
css/style.css and tf.js for the uncompressed CSS and Javascript code, 
respectively.

To add a Ning App by URL, use the following URL structure:
http://YOURNINGNETWORKNAMEHERE.ning.com/opensocial/ningapps/addByUrl
